# Rebels of the Sky

It's the year 2077. Corporations have taken over the world.
The only way to be free is to join a pirate crew and start plundering the galaxy. The only mean of survival is to play basketball.

Now it's your turn to go out there and make a name for yourself. Create your crew and start wondering the galaxy in search of worthy basketball opponents.

## Build

`cargo build --release`

This game runs as a terminal application, meaning that you just need to run the executable from your temrinal. Suggested minimal terminal size: 162x48. Not all terminals support the game nicely, so you might need to try different ones. Here is a list of tested terminals:

-   Linux: whatever the default terminal is, it should work
-   MacOs: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
-   Windows: need a tester :)
